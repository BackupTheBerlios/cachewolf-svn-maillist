<PRE>Author: mik77
Date: 2007-11-18 17:16:09 +0100 (Sun, 18 Nov 2007)
New Revision: 1083

Added:
   trunk/cw-pc.jnf
Removed:
   trunk/cwberlios.jnf
Modified:
   trunk/buildexe.bat
   trunk/buildexe.sh
   trunk/cw-pda.jnf
   trunk/fwrtsnapshot.sh
Log:
We have now two versions of the jnf-file one for PDAs (with /Xmx 12M switch) and one for PCs (without this option).
All scripts call the PDA version first and then the PC version. So the .ewe will be without /Xmx 12M.
